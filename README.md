starter-profile
===============

The STARTER_PROFILE is a starter Drupal installation profile that you can extend to build your Drupal sites.


Requirements
---------------

Here is what you need to use the STARTER_PROFILE:

* [System requirements for installing Drupal](http://drupal.org/requirements)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com)
* [Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush) (*Drush make* is included in Drush 5.x, but not included in older versions. If you happen to have an older Drush installed, it's strongly recommended to update it.)
